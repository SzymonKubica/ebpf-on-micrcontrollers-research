# Terms and nomenclature that I don't quite understand:

- PMP - Physical Memory Protection unit, is a part of the RISC-V Privileged
  Architecture Specification which discribes the interface for a standard
  RISC-V memory protection unit. The PMP defines a finite number of PMP regions
  which can be individually configured to enforce access permissions to a range
  of addresses in memory.
