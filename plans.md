## Suggested order of efforts

1. Complete the background research
2. Identify the possible areas of most impact
3. Perform testing of the existing eBPF implementation for RIOT and understand
   how it works
4. Identify the microkernel and the microcontroller to target for our efforts.

-> Arduino UNO R4
